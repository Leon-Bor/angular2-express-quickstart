# Angular2 ExpressJS Quickstart
Simple Angular2 repo with express for a quick start. No use of lite-server.
The default configurated view engine is [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/).

run `npm install`
then `npm start`

#### Optional

`npm install -g nodemon`

change in the package.json `node ./bin/www\` to `nodemon ./bin/www\`.Maybe you have to start the server now with `sudo npm start` because of nodemon.

#### Why

I made this repo because I use NodeJS as backend as well, so i don't need the Lite server. This will just save a little bit of time if you need something like this as well. 

Cheers.
